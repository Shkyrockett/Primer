# Multiplying By Elevens

Multiplying single digit numbers by 11 can be fun, since all you have to do is put the same number next to it. But the two digit numbers look intimidating, such as $12\times11=132$. However, there is this little trick:  
 > Split the two digits up $1\gets12\to2$. Add them together $1+2=3$ place the sum in the middle and push them together $1\to3\gets2=123$. And there you have it.
