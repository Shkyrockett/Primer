# Tick-Tac-Toe Multiplication

One method for helping people who are pattern focused, and have trouble with wrote memorization, remember multiplication is to use multiplication patterns.

Once the pattern has been internalized, the chart can be easily written out and used as a lookup table for multiplication and division.

The table is layed out as follows. The first cell belonging to the One cell, then the one below it two the Two cell, then below that the Three cell. From there, go back to the top of the table to the next column to continue, and repeat to the Ten cell.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| One cell $1\times x\downarrow$ | Four cell $4\times x\downarrow$ | Seven cell $7\times x\downarrow$ | Ten cell $10\times x\downarrow$ |
| Two cell $2\times x\downarrow$ | Five cell $5\times x\downarrow$ | Eight cell $8\times x\downarrow$ |
| Three cell $3\times x\nearrow$ | Six cell $6\times x\nearrow$ | Nine cell $9\times x\nearrow$ |

The values of each cell are divided into Tens and Ones parts. Patterns often start by manipulating the Ones parts then working with the Tens part of the numbers.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tens Ones | Tens Ones | Tens Ones | Hundreds Tens Ones |
| Tens Ones | Tens Ones | Tens Ones |
| Tens Ones | Tens Ones | Tens Ones |

One common pattern for table smaller than 10, is to increment the Tens column every time the Ones column is smaller than the previous Ones Column value in the table.

## Zeros

Zeros is the most simple pattern as anything times $0$ is $0$. So, just fill the grid with 0s.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |

## Ones

For Ones, just increment for each cell in the table.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $1$ | $4$ | $7$ | $10$ |
| $2$ | $5$ | $8$ |
| $3$ | $6$ | $9$ |

## Twos

The pattern for Twos is to start at two and skip every other number. The pattern then repeats after 5 x 2, but with an incremented tens place.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $2$ | $8$ | $14$ | $20$ |
| $4$ | $10$ | $16$ |
| $6$ | $12$ | $18$ |

## Threes

For the Threes, start on the right column moving left then down to the next row on the right incrementing the numbers. Then go back to 1 x 3 cell and move down the column, and over to the right, incrementing the tens every time the ones is smaller than the previous.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $3$ | $12$ | $21$ | $30$ |
| $6$ | $15$ | $24$ |
| $9$ | $18$ | $27$ |

## Fours

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $4$ | $16$ | $28$ | $40$ |
| $8$ | $20$ | $32$ |
| $12$ | $24$ | $36$ |

## Fives

The pattern for fives is to start with 5 then alternate every other ending with a 5 or 0, while incrementing the tens on each 0.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $5$ | $20$ | $35$ | $50$ |
| $10$ | $25$ | $40$ |
| $15$ | $30$ | $45$ |

## Sixes

For the Sixes, start on the right column moving left then down to the next row on the right incrementing the numbers by two, restarting after 5 x 6. Then go back to 1 x 3 cell and move down the column, and over to the right, incrementing the tens every time the ones is smaller than the previous.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $6$ | $24$ | $42$ | $60$ |
| $12$ | $30$ | $48$ |
| $18$ | $36$ | $54$ |

## Sevens

For Sevens, Start at the bottom left, going right, then up, and incrament the ones. Then go back to 1 x 3 cell and move down the column, and over to the right, incrementing the tens every time the ones is smaller than the previous.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $7$ | $28$ | $49$ | $70$ |
| $14$ | $35$ | $56$ |
| $21$ | $42$ | $63$ |

## Eights

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $8$ | $32$ | $56$ | $80$ |
| $16$ | $40$ | $64$ |
| $24$ | $48$ | $72$ |

## Nines

Nines is possibly the most fun of the patterns. Increment the ones column in reverse starting with 9, ending with 0 for 10 x 9. Then for the tens column increment from 0 in the 1 x 9 cell to 9 in the 10 x 9 cell. It is even more fun to fill out the table counting down form the first cell, then reversing again at the tenth counting down again to the first cell.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $09$ | $36$ | $63$ | $90$ |
| $18$ | $45$ | $72$ |
| $27$ | $54$ | $81$ |

## Tens

Tens is as simple as the Ones, just appending a 0 to the end.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $10$ | $40$ | $70$ | $100$ |
| $20$ | $50$ | $80$ |
| $30$ | $60$ | $90$ |

## Elevens

Elevens is another fun pattern, just duplicate the digits from the Ones table for both the Ones and Tens columns, up to 9. Then add a zero to 11 for the Tens cell.

|  |  |  |  |
|-|-|-|-|
| $11$ | $44$ | $77$ | $110$ |
| $22$ | $55$ | $88$ |
| $33$ | $66$ | $99$ |
