# Comparison $=$

Binary Equality operator.

| Name | Example | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Equation** | $3+2=5$ | An **Equation** is a formula involving the $=$ (equals) operator. The purpose of an equation is to solve it. You want to find the missing variable. <br /> An **equation** is a statement where sets of expressions are the same. |
| **Equals** | $3+2\color{red}{=}5$ | The act of comparing two or more expressions for equivalence. The $=$ sign indicates the expressions to either side are the same. |
| **Comparand** | $\color{red}{3+2}=5$ | The expression on the left being compared to. |
| **Comparanda** | $3+2=\color{red}{5}$ | The expression on the right to compare to the Comparand. |

Binary Inequality Operator

| Name | Example | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Inequality** | $3+2\color{red}{\ne}4$ | The $=$ sign indicates the expressions on either side are not equal. |
| **Comparand** | $\color{red}{3+2}\ne4$ | The expression on the left being compared to. |
| **Comparanda** | $3+2\ne\color{red}{4}$ | The expression on the right to compare to the Comparand. |
