| $k$ | k-component| Often denotes the third part of a vector. |
| $l$ | l-component| To denote the fourth part of a vector. |
| $x$ | x-coordinate | Often used as the horizontal component of a coordinate. |
| $y$ | y-coordinate | Often used as the vertical component of a coordinate. |
| $z$ | z-coordinate | Often used as the depth component of a coordinate. |

| $\overleftarrow{u}$, $\overrightarrow{u}$ | u-vector|  |
| $\overleftarrow{v}$, $\overrightarrow{v}$ | v-vector|  |
| $\overleftarrow{w}$, $\overrightarrow{w}$ | w-vector|  |
| $\widehat{u}$ | u unit vector |  |
| $\widehat{v}$ | v unit vector |  |
| $\widehat{w}$ | w unit vector |  |
| $A$ | Area | The area of a shape. |
| $C$ | Circumference | The circumference of a circle. |
| $r$ | Radius | The radius of a circle. |
| $d$ | Diameter| The diameter of a circle. |
| $\alpha$ | Alpha| angle |
| $\beta$ | Beta| angle |
| $\theta$ | Theta| The angle between two vectors|
| $\phi$ | Phi | The opposite angle between two vectors|

## Constant Variables

In some instances a numerical value is replaced with a symbolic representation that is always represented with the same symbol.

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|:---:|---|---|
| $\pi$ | $\approx3.1415926535897932384626433832795…$ | Pi is the irrational constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to it's radius. |
| $\tau$ | $\approx6.283185307179586476925286766559…$ | Tau is a proposed irrational constant intended to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to it's diameter. Or 2Pi. |
| $e$ | $\approx2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995…$ | Euler's number |
| $\infty$ | Infinity | Infinity |
