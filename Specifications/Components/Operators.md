# Operators

**Operators** are symbols used to denote an operation that needs to occur between values. The operators are highlighted in red below:

$2\color{red}\times\color{black}x^2\color{red}+\color{black}y\color{red}+\color{black}1\color{red}=\color{black}z$

## Order of Operations

| Order | Operators| Name| Description|
|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| 0 | $\|\|$, $()$, $[]$, $\{\}$, $\langle\rangle$ | Bars, Parenthesis, Brackets, Braces | Grouping Operators. Perform calculations within brackets first. |
| 1 | $x^2$, $\sqrt[y]{x}$, $\log_{10}{x}$, Functions | Exponents, Powers, Roots, Logarithms | Exponents, Powers, Roots, and Logarithms then follow. |
| 2 | $\times$, $\div$ | Multiply, Divide| Then Multiply and Divide. |
| 3 | $+$, $-$ | Addition Subtraction | All Addition and Subtraction is then done from left to right. |
| 4 | $<$, $\leq$, $=$, $\geq$, $>$ | Relationship | Comparison or Relationship operations. |
|  |  |  |  |

Below are tables of common operators.

## Relational Operators

| Symbol | Name | Operation |
|:---:|---|---|
| $=$ | Equals | Indicates that the expressions on either side are equal. |
| $\ne$ | Not Equal | Indicates that the expressions on either side are not equal. |
| $\approx$ | Approximately | Indicates that the expressions on either side are approximately equal. |
| $<$ | Less Than | Indicates that the expression on the left should be smaller than the expression on the right. |
| $\nless$ | Not Less Than | Indicates that the expression on the left should not be smaller than the expression on the right. |
| $\leq$ | Less Than Or Equal To | Indicates that the expression to the left should be less than or equal to the expression to the right. |
| $\nleq$ | Not Less Than Or Equal To | Indicates that the expression to the left should not be less than or equal to the expression to the right. |
| $>$ | Greater Than | Indicates that the expression to the left should be larger than the expression to the right. |
| $\ngtr$ | Not Greater Than | Indicates that the expression to the left should not be larger than the expression to the right. |
| $\geq$ | Greater Than Or Equal To | Indicates that the expression to the left should be larger or equal to the expression to the right. |
| $\ngeq$ | Not Greater Than Or Equal To | Indicates that the expression to the left should not be larger or equal to the expression to the right. |
|  |  |  |

## Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Name| Operation |
|:---:|---|---|
| $^+$ | Positive | Indicates a coefficient is positive. |
| $^-$ | Negate | Negates a coefficient, turning it to it's opposite sign. |
| $+$ | Add, or Plus | Adds the value of the left argument to the right. |
| $-$ | Minus aka Subtract | removes the value of the right argument from the left. |
| $\pm$ | Plus or Minus | There are two results, one positive, the other Negative. |
| $\mp$ | minus or plus | The sign is opposite the one on the other side. |
| $\times$ | Multiply also known as Times | Repeatedly adds the right value to the left. |
| $\div$ | Divide | Divides the left argument into the number of arguments on the right, or below. |
|  |  |  |

## Function Operators

| Symbol | Name | Operation |
|:---:|---|---|
| $x^\color{red}{2}$ | Exponent | Indicates how many times the multiplication should be used. |
| $\color{red}{\sqrt[2]{x}}$ | Root, Radix, or Radical | An inverse of the exponent, in finding the zeros of a number. |
| $\color{red}{\log}_{10}{x}$ | Logarithm| An inverse of an exponential. Indicates how many of a number needs to be multiplied to get another. |

## Operators and Order of Precedence

There are a few quirks on the order of precedence of operations.
