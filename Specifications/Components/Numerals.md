# Numerals

Numerals are the number component of an expression, often the constant component.  

## Bases

Generally in arabic mathematical notation, numbers are written in base 10. However computers work in Base 2 also known as Binary.  

In programming it is also common to use Base 16 known as Hexadecimal. This is because Computer binary is broken up into chunks of 8 bits known as a byte. Hexadecimal conveniently fits within the 8 bits as two significant units of Base 16 numerals.  

Some commonly used bases are listed in the table below.

| Base | Name | Numerals |
|---|---|---|
| **Base 2** | Binary | 0, 1 |
| **Base 8** | Octal | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 |
| **Base 10** | Decimal | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |
| **Base 12** | [Dozenal](http://www.dozenal.org/) | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b |
| **Base 16** | Hexadecimal | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f |

# Non-Rational Bases

Are they even possible? $\pi$ maybe?
